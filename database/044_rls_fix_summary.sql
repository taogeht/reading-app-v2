-- RLS Policy Fix Summary - Complete Solution for Supabase Security Advisor Errors
-- This file summarizes the complete RLS policy fix implementation

-- ===================================================================
-- PROBLEM SUMMARY
-- ===================================================================

/*
The Supabase Security Advisor reported the following errors:

1. "policy_exists_rls_disabled" on tables:
   - assignments
   - classes  
   - profiles
   - recording_submissions
   - recordings

2. "rls_disabled_in_public" on tables:
   - assignments
   - classes
   - profiles  
   - recordings
   - recording_submissions
   - class_sessions

ROOT CAUSE:
- Previous migration (035_emergency_rls_cleanup.sql) disabled RLS to fix infinite recursion
- Policies were left in place but non-functional
- Security advisor flagged this as a major security issue
*/

-- ===================================================================
-- SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
-- ===================================================================

/*
Created 6 migration files to systematically fix all RLS issues:

1. 038_cleanup_orphaned_policies.sql - Removed all orphaned policies
2. 039_enable_rls_profiles.sql - Re-enabled RLS on profiles with simple policies
3. 040_enable_rls_classes.sql - Re-enabled RLS on classes with simple policies  
4. 041_enable_rls_assignments.sql - Re-enabled RLS on assignments with simple policies
5. 042_enable_rls_recordings.sql - Re-enabled RLS on both recordings tables
6. 043_enable_rls_class_sessions.sql - Re-enabled RLS on class_sessions

EXECUTION ORDER:
Run migrations in numerical order: 038 → 039 → 040 → 041 → 042 → 043

-- POLICY ARCHITECTURE
-- ===================================================================

/*
Each table now has 3-4 simple, non-recursive policies:

PROFILES TABLE:
- "Users can read own profile" - auth.uid() = id
- "Users can update own profile" - auth.uid() = id  
- "Users can insert own profile" - auth.uid() = id
- "Service role full access to profiles" - service_role bypass

CLASSES TABLE:
- "Teachers can manage own classes" - teacher_id = auth.uid()
- "Anonymous users can read classes" - anonymous student access
- "Authenticated users can read active classes" - teacher reference
- "Service role full access to classes" - service_role bypass

ASSIGNMENTS TABLE:
- "Teachers can manage class assignments" - EXISTS check on class ownership
- "Anonymous users can read published assignments" - student access
- "Authenticated users can read published assignments" - teacher reference
- "Service role full access to assignments" - service_role bypass

RECORDINGS/RECORDING_SUBMISSIONS TABLES:
- "Students can manage own recordings" - student_id match or NULL
- "Teachers can view class recordings" - EXISTS check on class ownership
- "Service role full access to recordings" - service_role bypass

CLASS_SESSIONS TABLE:
- "Teachers can manage class sessions" - EXISTS check on class ownership
- "Anonymous users can view active sessions" - student access
- "Authenticated users can view active sessions" - teacher reference
- "Service role full access to class_sessions" - service_role bypass
*/

-- ===================================================================
-- KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-- ===================================================================

/*
1. NO RECURSIVE POLICIES:
   - Policies never reference the same table they're defined on
   - Avoided infinite recursion that caused original issues

2. SIMPLE EXISTENCE CHECKS:
   - Used EXISTS subqueries instead of complex joins
   - Single-level table references only

3. SERVICE ROLE BYPASS:
   - All complex operations handled via service_role in application layer
   - Admin operations don't trigger policy evaluation

4. ANONYMOUS ACCESS SUPPORT:
   - Student visual password authentication uses anonymous role
   - Appropriate read-only access for students

5. SECURITY BOUNDARIES:
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Teachers can only access their class data
   - Published content is appropriately readable
*/

-- ===================================================================
-- EXPECTED RESULTS
-- ===================================================================

/*
After running all migrations, the Security Advisor should show:

✅ NO "policy_exists_rls_disabled" errors
✅ NO "rls_disabled_in_public" errors  
✅ RLS enabled on all public tables
✅ Functional policies that don't cause recursion
✅ Application continues to work normally

TABLES WITH RLS ENABLED:
- profiles ✅
- classes ✅
- assignments ✅
- recordings ✅
- recording_submissions ✅
- class_sessions ✅
*/

-- ===================================================================
-- VERIFICATION QUERY
-- ===================================================================

-- Run this query to verify RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
    AND tablename IN ('profiles', 'classes', 'assignments', 'recordings', 'recording_submissions', 'class_sessions')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Run this query to verify policies exist
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    roles,
    cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- ===================================================================
-- ROLLBACK INSTRUCTIONS (IF NEEDED)
-- ===================================================================

/*
If issues occur, you can temporarily disable RLS again:

ALTER TABLE public.profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.classes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.assignments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.recordings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.recording_submissions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.class_sessions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

Then investigate and fix specific policy issues before re-enabling.
