# Audio Caching Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
- **Costly API Calls**: Every TTS request makes a fresh API call to ElevenLabs (~$0.30 per 1K characters)
- **Performance Delays**: Students wait 10-30 seconds for audio generation each time
- **Reliability Concerns**: API failures can disrupt classroom activities
- **Repeated Costs**: Same story generates multiple API calls across different students/sessions

### Educational Context Requirements
- **Teacher Portal**: Teachers need to prepare content for classes
- **Class Sharing**: Multiple students and classes should access the same audio files
- **Predictable Costs**: Schools need budget predictability for audio generation
- **Classroom Reliability**: Audio must work consistently during lessons

## Storage Strategy Analysis

### Client-Side Storage (Not Recommended for Schools)
**IndexedDB Browser Storage:**
- **Location**: User's local browser storage (50MB-2GB per domain)
- **Pros**: No server infrastructure, instant access after first load
- **Cons**: 
  - Storage per-user/per-browser only
  - Can be cleared by users
  - No sharing between students
  - Not suitable for classroom environment

### Server-Side Storage (RECOMMENDED)
**Static File System Storage:**
- **Location**: Server filesystem organized by educational content
- **Pros**:
  - Permanent storage (never deleted)
  - Shared across all users and classes
  - Predictable storage management
  - Works with existing web server infrastructure
  - No database complexity needed

**File Structure Example:**
```
/public/audio-library/
  /system-stories/           # Built-in curriculum stories
    /grade-1/
      /little-red-hen/
        usa-female-bella.mp3
        usa-male-josh.mp3
        uk-female-charlotte.mp3
        uk-male-daniel.mp3
      /tortoise-and-hare/
        usa-female-bella.mp3
        usa-male-josh.mp3
        uk-female-charlotte.mp3
        uk-male-daniel.mp3
    /grade-2/
      /boy-who-cried-wolf/
        [voice variations...]
  /teacher-uploads/          # Custom teacher content
    /teacher-123/
      /my-custom-story/
        [voice variations...]
  /subjects/                 # Organized by subject area
    /phonics/
    /reading-comprehension/
    /vocabulary/
```

## Pre-Generation vs On-Demand Analysis

### Pre-Generation Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Advantages for Educational Environment:**
- **Teacher Control**: Teachers prepare all audio content before class begins
- **Predictable Costs**: All generation happens during setup phase
- **Classroom Reliability**: No dependency on API availability during lessons
- **Instant Performance**: Students get immediate audio playback
- **Quality Control**: Teachers can preview and approve audio before students hear it
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient generation of multiple stories/voices at once
- **Network Independence**: Works even with poor classroom internet

**Cost Analysis:**
- Generate 20 stories × 4 voice combinations = 80 files
- One-time cost vs. potentially 100s of repeated API calls
- Predictable budget planning for schools

### On-Demand Generation (Problems for Classrooms)
**Issues:**
- **Timing Unpredictability**: First student waits 30+ seconds while others are ready
- **API Dependency**: Entire class stops if ElevenLabs service has issues
- **Cost Variability**: Unexpected bills if students replay content
- **Network Congestion**: Multiple students triggering simultaneous API calls
- **Classroom Disruption**: Technical delays interrupt lesson flow

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Static Audio File System
1. **File Organization**: Implement hierarchical folder structure
2. **Audio Manifest**: JSON file tracking available audio files
3. **URL Generation**: Create predictable URLs for audio files
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Generate on-demand only if pre-generated file missing

### Phase 2: Teacher Portal Integration
1. **Bulk Generation Interface**: "Generate all voices for Grade 1 stories"
2. **Audio Library Browser**: Preview and manage generated audio files
3. **Progress Tracking**: Show generation status and completion
4. **Quality Control**: Listen and regenerate if needed

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Custom Story Upload**: Teachers add their own stories + generate audio
2. **Voice Presets**: Set preferred voices per class/grade level
3. **Batch Operations**: Generate multiple stories with selected voice combinations
4. **Storage Management**: Monitor disk usage and cleanup tools

## Technical Implementation Details

### No Database Required
- **File System as Database**: Folder structure provides organization
- **Metadata in Filenames**: Encode story ID, voice settings in filename
- **JSON Manifest**: Simple index file for quick lookups
- **Standard Web Server**: Serve files as static assets

### Integration Points
**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/TTSPlayer.tsx`: Check for pre-generated files first
- `src/services/elevenLabsService.ts`: Add file-checking logic
- `src/types/index.ts`: Add audio library interfaces

**Files to Create:**
- `src/services/audioLibraryService.ts`: Manage static audio files
- `src/utils/audioFileUtils.ts`: Generate predictable filenames/URLs
- Admin tools for bulk generation (separate from main app)

### URL Structure
```
/audio-library/system-stories/grade-1/little-red-hen/usa-female-bella.mp3
/audio-library/teacher-uploads/teacher-123/custom-story/uk-male-daniel.mp3
```

### Filename Convention

- **Classroom Scale**: 25 students × multiple recordings = significant ongoing costs
- **Internet Dependency**: Requires stable internet for real-time analysis
- **Privacy Concerns**: Student voice data sent to external services

### Educational Context Requirements
- **Teacher Review**: Teachers need to listen to and assess student recordings
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor student improvement over time
- **Bulk Processing**: Handle entire classroom recordings efficiently
- **Data Privacy**: Keep student voice data within school network

## Local Whisper Server Solution (RECOMMENDED)

### Why Whisper on Unraid Server Is Perfect for Schools

- **Budget Predictability**: No per-use charges for student recordings
- **Scale Economics**: Handle entire school district without additional costs

**Privacy and Security:**
- **Data Sovereignty**: All student recordings stay on school network
- **FERPA Compliance**: No external data sharing with cloud services
- **Network Isolation**: Can operate completely offline after setup
- **Local Control**: School IT manages all data and processing

**Reliability for Classrooms:**
- **No Internet Dependency**: Works during network outages
- **Consistent Performance**: No API rate limits or service disruptions
- **Batch Processing**: Can process recordings overnight or during off-hours
- **Unlimited Usage**: Handle peak classroom loads without throttling

### Technical Architecture

**Unraid Server Setup:**
```
Unraid Server Components:
├── Whisper Docker Container (openai/whisper or custom API wrapper)
├── Audio Storage (/mnt/user/student-recordings/)
├── Processing Queue (for batch analysis)
├── Database (SQLite or PostgreSQL for metadata)
├── Web API (Node.js/Python for REST endpoints)
└── Teacher Dashboard (web interface)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor (Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 minimum)
- **RAM**: 8GB+ for larger Whisper models (16GB recommended)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU optional but significantly speeds processing
- **Storage**: Plan for ~1MB per minute of student audio (expandable)

**Docker Container Options:**
- `openai/whisper` - Official OpenAI container
- `onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice` - REST API wrapper
- Custom FastAPI wrapper for educational features

### Student Recording Workflow (Simplified)

**New Student Experience (No Instant Feedback Pressure):**
1. **Record**: Student reads the story into microphone
2. **Preview**: Optional "Listen to your recording" playback button
3. **Submit**: "Send to teacher" button uploads to server
4. **Confirmation**: "Great job! Your recording has been saved for your teacher to review."

**Benefits of Delayed Analysis:**
- **Reduced Anxiety**: Students don't stress about immediate automated feedback
- **Authentic Assessment**: Teachers provide human feedback, not just algorithmic scores
- **Natural Learning**: Focus on reading, not gaming the AI system
- **Teacher Control**: Educators decide when and how to provide feedback
